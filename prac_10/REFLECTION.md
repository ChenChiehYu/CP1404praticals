CP1404 - Chieh Yu Chen

I estimate my accuracy was around 70% before the class starts, and based on the practical results it increased into 80% right now.

About code reviewing, I realize there are lots of different methods for the same task, there's no best but only better solution.
And code reviewing helps me learning how to improve my codes.

In my opinion, I would like to remove the last question in prac 07 which has equal length as our assignment 1, or put it into extra practical.
